# aiida-phonopy
AiiDA plugin for the phonopy code (phonons from finite differences)

(Note: this is a very old unmaintained repository - refer to the [AiiDA plugin registry](https://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry/) for updated plugins for AiiDA.

This is still experimental and unsupported until its first "official" release
(meaning that you can use it, but we will not be able to give support in case of problems).
